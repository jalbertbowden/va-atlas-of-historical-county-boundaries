<dd>

This document serves as the metadata for the U.S. Historical Counties (Generalized .001 deg) shapefile for use in a geographic information system (GIS). This file may be downloaded without charge from this Web site (<a href="http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp">&lt;http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp&gt;</a>); see also Distribution_Information (below).
<br/>
This dataset is a generalized version of the U.S. Historical Counties shapefile, based on a tolerance of .001 degrees. The U.S. Historical Counties shapefile was derived from the individual state datasets published by the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries project. A number of adjustments were made to the individual state files to produce the full United States dataset, as detailed in the Process_Step discussion (below).
<br/>
The U.S. Historical Counties shapefile holds the polygons, metadata, and attribute data for every different configuration of every county or county equivalent in the area that became the fifty United States, dated to the day, from 4 March 1629 through 31 December 2000. This dataset enables users easily to employ a geographic information system for the analysis and display of county-related historical data. This downloadable dataset is provided in shapefile format in a geographic coordinate system (unprojected), so that it would be as accessible as possible to various GIS software.

</dd>
<dt><em>Purpose:</em>  
<dd>

This dataset provides a synthesis in shapefile format of the individual state files created by the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries project. The metadata for the individual state files provide a detailed description of the methodology used to research, plot, and digitize the historical county boundaries.

</dd>
<dt><em>Supplemental_Information:</em>  
<dd>

The Atlas aims to be absolutely comprehensive and, with a few exceptions (see next paragraph), to leave no &quot;holes&quot; in its historical and geographic coverage of a state. Each non-county area, whether an accidental gore or a region purposely set aside for future settlement, is represented by a polygon, the polygon is named (often merely as a non-county area with a number, such as NCA1), and a full set of data about it is entered in the database and the attribute file.
<br/>
The exceptions to the &quot;no-holes&quot; policy described above are the large non-county areas in western Virginia, New York, and the New England states during much of the seventeenth century. In London and the other European capitals, officials had access to so little accurate information about inland territory that imperial claims and land grants, including colonial charters, often were incomplete or imprecise or asserted limits (e.g., the Pacific Ocean or &quot;South Sea&quot;) that were so extreme as to be impractical to plot. Compilers treated those large, indefinitely bounded, and inadequately described, non-county areas as empty territory and made no attempt to represent them as coherent, historically complete polygons. In other cases the compilers supplied estimated boundary lines to close polygons representing indefinitely extensive frontier counties and noted their action in the CHANGE field.
<br/>
Some changes have not been mapped because the change is too small to map, or the location is unknown, or both; for example, a law that transferred ten acres belonging to farmer Smith from one county to another would be unmappable because the parcel is too small to be mapped at the standard compilation scale or because the location of Smith's farm cannot be discovered. In some cases, information as to the location and date of changes too small to map is available with the individual state datasets.
<br/>
State exceptions: In the case of South Carolina there were three overlapping layers of county-level jurisdiction; counties (10 May 1682 - 28 Jul 1769, and 12 Mar 1785 - 31 Dec 2000), parishes (30 Nov 1706 - 26 Sep 1865), and judicial districts (29 Jul 1769 - 15 Apr 1868). Louisiana also had two overlapping layers of jurisdiction; counties (10 Apr 1805 - 24 Jan 1846), and parishes (14 Apr 1807 - 31 Dec 2000). Polygons for all of these overlapping jurisdictions are included in the dataset, with the layer specified by the CNTY_TYPE field value. In addition, all changes for Alaska are by either the end of the particular census year, or by the official date of the census (when known). Alaska boroughs and census areas are treated as county equivalents in the dataset.

This dataset provides a synthesis in shapefile format of the individual state datasets created by the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries project. The Atlas aims to achieve high accuracy through the use of the most authoritative and reliable sources, analysis of those sources by tested procedures, and careful proofreading of the results. Because counties are created and changed by their states, the state session laws are the primary, authoritative sources for the county lines, names, organization, and attachments. The initial plots of the boundaries are direct conversions of the legal boundary descriptions in the laws into linework on the plotting sheets. They are performed with copies of the legal descriptions at hand, and those same laws also are at hand for the GIS compiler when digitizing boundaries. All other sources, including old maps, are derived from those legal descriptions. The historical compiler searches the state session laws and, when necessary, related material (e.g., court decisions, executive proclamations) for information about the courses of the boundaries. Secondary texts, maps, and local experts are consulted as needed (e.g., when recovering a long-lost landmark that figured in an early boundary description). Dates of changes are also taken from the laws. Some laws specify when the change will go into effect, but others (mostly those passed before the twentieth century) do not; if no official effective date is provided, the historical compiler uses the date when the law was passed or approved.
<br/>
The locations of places and landmarks cited in the boundary descriptions are gathered from the modern, federal base maps or from secondary publications (e.g., gazetteers, county histories, articles in historical journals), old maps, or local experts.
<br/>
Details regarding the steps taken to insure the accuracy of the boundaries as they are plotted and digitized are available in the metadata for the individual state datasets.

<dt><em>Logical_Consistency_Report:</em>  
<dd>

This shapefile is a generalized version of the U.S. Historical Counties shapefile, and contains the same number of features as the original shapefile. The generalized dataset was initially created as a time-coded polygon feature class within an ESRI ArcGIS personal geodatabase, and ArcGIS tools were used to validate the polygon geometry. The procedures used to generalize the shapefile ensure that, as in the original file, the subset of polygons in effect at any given date from 4 Mar 1629 - 31 Dec 2000 is topologically correct, with no unexpected polygon gaps or overlaps. There are a number of known polygon overlaps, however, due to legislative or surveying errors, overlapping jurisdictions, and to conflicting territorial claims. As a final step, the polygon feature class was converted to a shapefile.

</dd>
<dt><em>Completeness_Report:</em>  
<dd>

The dataset is complete. All changes are dated to the day. If there is a difference between the effective date of change and the date when a law was passed, the effective date of change is used. Boundary changes too small to map are excluded from the shapefile. As a rule, boundary changes occurring entirely on water were not mapped. Exceptions to this rule might include county boundaries which run through large inland water bodies like Lake Okeechobee, Lake Pontchartrain, Great Salt Lake, etc.
<br/>
No regular or systematic updating of the pre-2001 data is anticipated because (a) the historical data cannot change and (b) the compilers believe their methods and materials are sufficient to produce data that are complete and correct. (That is not to say no error can slip through. Suggestions for ad hoc changes or additions to the historical data, together with an explanation of why the change should be made and supporting evidence, should be directed to scholl@newberry.org or Dr. William M. Scholl Center for American History and Culture, The Newberry Library, 60 W. Walton St., Chicago, IL 60610). County boundary changes that occur after 31 December 2000 will routinely be digitized by the various states and the federal government and, therefore, will be available from agencies of those governments in separate files in the indefinite future.

The individual state historical county boundary shapefiles were used to produce the full U.S. Historical Counties boundary file.

<dt><em>Process_Description:</em>  
<dd>

The U.S. Historical County dataset was derived from the individual state datasets published by the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries project. The individual state datasets were first combined, and then a number of adjustments were made to produce the full United States dataset.
<br/>
First, duplicate copies of counties were removed. These generally were early versions of counties that crossed several modern state borders, and were therefore included in several state files. The attribute values of the retained copies were revised as appropriate for the United States dataset.
<br/>
Proposed counties were removed, as were counties from the extralegal Territory of Jefferson. Polygons representing overlap areas between counties or disputed areas were also removed.
<br/>
County boundary changes occurring after 31 December 2000 were eliminated from the dataset. This removed Broomfield, Colorado, which was created on 15 November 2001.
<br/>
Areas under the jurisdiction of foreign governments after the colonial period were excluded. These included Spanish areas in Texas and Florida, British areas in Florida, Mexican municipalities established in Texas, as well as several counties established in New Mexico before that area became part of the United States.
<br/>
Partial counties within separate state files were combined as necessary to form complete versions of various counties or territories, such as the Unorganized Federal Territory and the Northwest Territory.
<br/>
In some cases new polygons were added to the dataset, generally for early territorial areas such as the Louisiana Purchase and Department of Alaska which were not included in the individual state shapefiles.
<br/>
Additional county polygons were added to the United States dataset when there was a jurisdictional change without a county boundary change; for example, when an area changed from Wyoming Territory to the state of Wyoming. With these additional polygons it became possible to assign a unique jurisdiction code to each individual county version (the STATE_TERR field). This code supports the display of various U.S. state and territorial jurisdictions at any date, and allows the production of a state/territory jurisdiction shapefile. The information necessary to code the jurisdictional changes was obtained from the attribute tables and county chronologies provided with the individual state historical county boundary files. In a few instances a single county version fell into two jurisdictions, in which case the county polygon was divided into separate polygons for each jurisdiction.

Topology Check. A multi-step process was applied to ensure that historical county polygons fit together precisely at all dates. The first step was to convert the United States dataset (BASE3) to a polygon feature class in an ESRI geodatabase. ArcMap tools were then used to planarize the polygon boundary lines in the historical county feature class, and to create polygons from these lines. This resulted in a new feature class consisting of non-overlapping component polygons. The ESRI topology functionality was applied to the component polygons to detect overlaps and gaps, and to snap vertices to the ESRI modern county polygon feature class.
<br/>
Based on the original historical county data, a table was created to specify, for each component polygon, the different counties to which it belonged and the time frames. The table was programmatically checked to verify that each component polygon was correctly assigned to historical counties throughout its life, with no unexpected gaps or overlaps.
<br/>
The component polygons were then reassembled back into the historical counties, and converted to a shapefile. The resulting historical county shapefile consists of a large number of overlapping polygons; however, as a result of the topology check process, the subset of counties in effect at any selected date is topologically correct, with no unexpected gaps or overlaps. There are a number of known gaps and overlaps, however, due to legislative or surveying errors, overlapping jurisdictions, and conflicting territorial claims.

<dd>

The U.S. Historical County dataset was generalized to smooth the boundary lines and reduce the database size for faster display at small scales. The generalization process maintained polygon topology, so that the subset of counties in effect at any selected date remained topologically correct, with no unexpected gaps or overlaps. The generalized dataset contains the same number of county polygons as the original detailed dataset, along with the same attribute data. A tolerance of 0.001 degrees was applied to this dataset.

As the first step in generalizing the dataset, a large number of very small islands were removed from Maine and Alaska counties. This had a minimal impact on the overall area for counties in these states.
<br/>
The generalization process began with the final component polygons produced in the topology check process above. ArcGIS tools were then used to convert the component polygon borders to lines, planarize these lines, and smooth the lines based on the selected tolerance. The smoothed lines were next used to create generalized component polygons, and each new component polygon was matched to the appropriate original component polygon. The generalized polygons were reassembled into historical counties based on the table used in the topology check process described above.
<br/>
A different process was used for Alaska, as that state's data was not based on component polygons. All changes for Alaska are by either the end of the particular census year, or by the official date of the census (when known). For each census date, the subset of counties in effect was selected, and the county boundaries were generalized using ArcGIS tools.

Whereas the ID_NUM values (see above) uniquely identify the different polygons, the ID code identifies unique geographical institutions, i.e., states, counties, and other administrative entities. The ID code is stable across the entire dataset; it does not change when there is a change in the county's name, shape, size, location, or parent state or equivalent. Each county's unique identifier is set in terms of its current or most recent state affiliation. Hence, &quot;mes_York&quot; is the identifier for modern York County, Maine, and all its earlier versions, even though it was created as part of colonial Massachusetts.

<dt><em>Attribute_Label:</em>  FIPS</dt>

<dd>

FIPS codes are provided for the convenience of researchers working with data that has already been labeled with numbers from that coding system. FIPS is the abbreviation of Federal Information Processing Standard. FIPS codes were created in the first half of the twentieth century and are meant to facilitate efficiency and clarity in data handling. The system provides a two-digit code for each state or equivalent and a three-digit code for each county or equivalent. (Sometimes those codes are combined into five-digit numbers that start with the two digits for the state, as in this attribute table). The FIPS codes for states and counties in existence at the end of 2000 were taken from the federal government's FIPS PUB 6-4 (created 1996, last modified 10 May 2002), and the codes for extinct counties were taken from earlier lists. Some counties or other administrative entities may have no FIPS codes. In some cases they represent historical counties that became extinct before the introduction of FIPS codes; in other cases they represent temporary non-county areas. In the attribute table the FIPS field for those areas and extinct counties has been left blank because there is no standard system for pre-FIPS colonies, territories, and counties and no coding system includes non-county areas. Of course, users may supply a FIPS substitute of their own creation or, for extinct early counties, adopt an existing, alternative coding scheme, such as the one employed by Richard L. Forstall in his compilation, &quot;Population of States and Counties of the United States: 1790-1990&quot; (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1996). In addition, as described above under Attribute Label: ID, the Atlas developed a parallel system of non-FIPS Identifiers to encode all states, counties, and equivalents; it is more flexible and working with it is easier than using the FIPS codes.

Values to link United States county polygons with the original counties included in the state datasets of the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries. The values in the CROSS_REF field generally follow the ID_Version_Dataset format. For example, the entry &quot;ils_cook_4_IL_Historical_Counties&quot; indicates that the polygon was based on the county in the Atlas state files with ID = ils_cook, Version = 4, Dataset = IL_Historical_Counties. Only one county is referenced, though there may have been identical copies of the same county in several state datasets. Entries such as &quot;Jurisdiction Change&quot; or &quot;New&quot; are used in cases where the United States dataset contains a polygon not found in the original state files.
